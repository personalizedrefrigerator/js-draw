 * Bug fixes
    * Fixed selection z-index not reset when undoing a deserialized selection transform command.

# 1.10.0

 * Bug fixes
   * Edge toolbar: Fix edge menu text using incorrect CSS variable (it should use `--foreground-color-2` to match `--background-color-2`).

# 1.0.2

 * Removes default link from the about screen.
   * `js-draw` can run in contexts where links are not expected.

Special thanks to:
- [Joplin SAS](https://joplinapp.org/) for supporting the development of this release
- Marta Le Colloec (@MartaLC) for [designing the new toolbar!](https://www.figma.com/file/NA5F2AMWO3wUuaoDfUaAb8/Material-3-wireframes?type=design&node-id=54490%3A1103&mode=design&t=Ee0UwnPnQ2bNC2uM-1)

Breaking changes (see [the migration guide](https://js-draw.web.app/typedoc/modules/Additional_Documentation.MigratingToVersion1__.html))
 * The `--secondary-foreground-color` and `--secondary-background-color` are no longer used for selected items. Use `--selection-foreground-color` and `--selection-background-color` instead.
 * The `Pen` constructor now accepts parameters in a different format — the `PenStyle` should contain the pen factory.
 * Timestamps in `Pointer`s and `StrokeDataPoint`s use `performance.now` instead of `Date.now`.
 * A more specific selector than `.imageEditorContainer` is now required to override the `width` and `height` of an editor. Use `.js-draw.imageEditorContainer` or `body .imageEditorContainer`.

Other changes
 * New default toolbar (see [makeEdgeToolbar](https://personalizedrefrigerator.github.io/js-draw/typedoc/functions/js_draw.makeEdgeToolbar.html)).
 * New material icon pack
 * Preserve `<g>` element parents when writing SVGs.
 * Fix: Editor thinks control key is still pressed after shortcuts like `ctrl+Tab` that defocus the editor before a keyup event is sent for `ctrl`.

# 0.25.1
 * Bug fixes
   * Fixes a bug in old versions of Chromium-based browsers: Strokes disappear on left mouse button up.

# 0.25.0
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix strokes sometimes not scaling correctly when zooming.

 * Other changes
   * New UI for pen subtypes.

# 0.24.1
 * Bug fixes
   * Fixed a regression from v0.24.0: Some key combinations were recognized incorrectly. For example, `r` and `R` both, by default, caused the screen to rotate in the same direction (rather than opposite directions).

# 0.24.0
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix italic `<text ...></text>` objects not supported.
 * Features
   * Support rendering relatively positioned text loaded from SVGs.
   * New drawable shape: circle. (Note, however, that SVG ellipses/elliptical arcs are **not** yet suppported.)
   * Exposes an API that allows configuration of *some* keyboard shortcuts.

# 0.23.1
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix regression: overflow menu in toolbar could be pushed off screen on window resize.

# 0.22.0
 * Improved German localization (thanks to @Mr-Kanister)
 * Behavior changes
   * Closing the color picker:
     * Don't draw when the user **clicks** on the canvas to close the color picker. Drawing is still done if the user clicks and drags.

# 0.21.0
 * Color picker (adjustments to integration of the [Coloris library](https://github.com/melloware/coloris-npm))
   * Allow the user to start drawing without an extra click when closing the color picker.
   * Increase the size of sliders' touch targets for easier selection.
 * Adjust stroke smoothing: Strokes should now be closer to user input.
 * Erasing and selecting: Use the edge rather than the center of strokes to determine eraser/selection intersection.
   * This was previously only the case for filled strokes (as produced by the flat-tip pen).

# 0.20.0
 * Added option for grid-patterned background.

# 0.19.0
 * (Experimental) Sound-based image browsing.
   - Pressing tab repeatedly shows an "Enable sound-based exploration" button. Clicking this button plays a sound when a user subsequently clicks on the canvas. The sound is based on the color under the cursor.
 * Fixed
   - Pinch-zooming on a trackpad would zoom in to a point roughly 50px below the cursor.
   - Buttons accessible only by pressing "tab" repeatedly were hidden behind the editor's canvas in some browsers.

# 0.18.2
 * Fix essential files missing from NPM.

# 0.18.1
 * Fix CommonJS module imports for some usecases.
   - Adds `@babel/runtime` as a dependency, which seems to be required to process some `require` calls.

 * Fix `isRestylableComponent` not exported.
 * Add a method to get the `Editor`'s average background color.

# 0.17.2
 * Bug fixes
   - TextComponent: Fix sub-components not cloning when cloning a parent `TextComponent`
     - This was causing duplicated `TextComponent`s to have, in part, the same styles as the original, even after attempting to restyle them with the restyle tool.
   - Find tool: Don't add viewport transformations to the undo stack.
   - Collaborative editing: Fix changing background size/location not synced between editors.
   - Upgrades dependencies to latest versions ([see commit for details](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/js-draw/commit/427a64037320ca96232d47f268258206398f3796))

   - [Only partially fixed] Fix restyling duplicated TextComponents also restyling the original.
   - Fix contents of overflow menu not changing on screen resize if the overflow menu was open.

# 0.17.0
 * Breaking changes
   - `SerializableCommand::serialize` may no longer serialize accurately when the command to serialize is not on top of the undo/redo stack. (This change was made to improve performance.)
 * Toolbar overflow menu:
   - Prefer horizontal menu to veritcal for only 1-2 overflow items.
   - Prefer wrapping to scrolling.
 * Bug fixes
   - Undo/redo events are now consistently fired after the command is initially applied.

   - Buttons are still moved to a second row on tall screens.

# 0.15.2
 * Bug fixes
   * Don't select/erase objects that have `isSelectable` set to `false`.
     - Previously, some objects used to store information about the image (e.g. attributes on the root `svg` object) could be selected and erased.
   * Round points created by rectangle, arrow, and line tools to prevent unnecessary decimal places in the output.
   * Performance improvement while zooming in on strokes.
   * Fix view jumping while zooming in/rotating with touchscreen pan tool.

# 0.15.1

# 0.14.0
 * Adjust default snap distance.
 * Allow selection tool to mirror objects.
 * Bug fixes
   * Allow the meta key (cmd) to activate keyboard shortcuts. (E.g. cmd+a on MacOS should select all).

   * Increase size of icons in newer versions of Safari (they had decreased in size).

# 0.13.1
 * Touchscreen panning: Rotation snapping
 * Bug fixes
   * Snap viewport rotation to multiples of 90° when touchscreen panning (and near a multiple of 90°).

# 0.13.0
 * Ctrl key: Snap to grid
 * New pen icons
 * Bug fixes:
   * Styling in output SVG: Prevent other renderers from collapsing multiple
     spaces into a single space.
   * Ends an in-progress stroke and adds it to the redo stack if ctrl+z is pressed while drawing a stroke.


# 0.12.0
 * Make the eraser's size adjustable.
 * Bug fixes:
   * Fixed a regression with the selection tool where pressing `Ctrl+D` while dragging the selection wouldn't duplicate at the selection's current location.
   * Fixed a regression where, in some browsers (Chrome, but not Firefox), editing a text component would duplicate that component.

# 0.11.3
 * Adjust default pen sizes.
 * Fix arrow/line icons being difficult to see with very thin stroke sizes.
 * Potential fix for content of current text input being discarded when clicking "save".
 * Loading images: Minor performance improvement.

# 0.11.2

 * Inertial scrolling: Workaround issue on some devices on touch gesture cancel.

# 0.10.3
 * Inertial scrolling: Don't start inertial scroll if a gesture was, in total, shorter than roughly 30 ms. Such gestures can be caused accidentally. For example, by resting/lifting a hand from a device screen.

# 0.10.2
 * Performance improvements

# 0.10.1
 * Different icons for rounded pens.
 * Bug fixes
   * Different pen types, for the same size, previously had different actual widths.

 * Text toolbar widget: Added a font size option.

# 0.9.2
 * Added a find dialog that can be opened with `ctrl+f`

# 0.9.1
 * Bug fixes:
  * Fix line tool producing an open shape. This caused issues with erasing and zooming in on these shapes.
  * Export SVG images with `fill='none'` instead of `fill='#00000000'` — some SVG readers ignore the transparency encoded in `#00000000`.

# 0.9.0
 * Allow saving toolbar widget state (see `HTMLToolbar#serializeState` and `HTMLToolbar#deserializeState`).
  * Breaking change: Toolbar widgets now require an `id`. As such, the order and number of parameters to `BaseWidget` has changed.
 * Add rotation lock button to hand toolbar widget.
 * Bug fixes
   * Fixed colors of color picker previews not matching value of the input (and thus not matching the actual color of the tool).
   * Fixed `Path::fromRect` producing an open shape. This caused issues with collision detection (for erasing and determining whether the rectangles should be visible).

# 0.8.0
 * Use non-pressure-sensitive strokes by default for most tools
   * These strokes should be have fewer bugs/issues than the pressure sensitive strokes.

# 0.7.2

 * `HandToolWidget` now expects, but does not require, a primary hand tool to work properly. See `ToolController#addPrimaryTool`.
 * **Breaiking changes:**
   * Icons are no longer accessible through `import {makeFooIcon} from '...'`. Use `editor.icons.makeFooIcon` instead.

# 0.5.0
 * Increase contrast between selection box/background
 * Keyboard shortcuts
   * `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9`: Switch pen drawing mode.
     * For this to work, the `ToolbarShortcutHandler` must be loaded (and the toolbar must also be loaded).
 * Bug fixes
