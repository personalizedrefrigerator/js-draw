# Updating js-draw

In general, `js-draw` releases follow [Semantic Versioning (semver)](https://github.com/semver/semver/blob/master/semver.md). This means that version numbers are broken up into three parts:

- The major version (e.g. 2 in **2**.1.0).
- The minor version (e.g. 1 in 2.**1**.0).
- The patch version (e.g. 0 in 2.1.**0**).

Only major version updates should include breaking changes. When a new major version is released, a new document should be added under this "Migrations" section.
