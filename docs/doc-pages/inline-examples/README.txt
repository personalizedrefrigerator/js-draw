These examples can be included in the [js-draw documentation](https://personalizedrefrigerator.github.io/js-draw/typedoc/)
with include tags like
```
[[include:doc-pages/inline-examples/settings-example.md]]
```

Keeping longer examples in this directory helps prevent the main code directory from becoming cluttered.
